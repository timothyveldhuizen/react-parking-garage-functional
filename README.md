# React Parking Garage (functional components)

A example app using React functional components to search for parking garages in the Netherlands.

## Components

ParkingGarages: contains the whole feature of filtering parking garages
SearchPlace: contains input field to search for a parking garage by place
SearchFilter: contains options to filter for parking garage
ParkingGarageList: contains a list of parking garages
ParkingGarageItem: contains parking garage information

## Data

SearchPlace: dynamic data that changes over time (in this case user input)
SearchFilter: dynamic data that changes over time (in this case user input)
ParkingGarageList: static data from external source (json)
ParkingGarageItem: static data from external source (json)

## Challenge

The challenge is to build with React functional components and React hooks above components with a correct component communication.
That means data flows down with props or data flows up with events between components.
And having the state / data in the correct components.
